# Packer h-1

<br>
For this home work I used previous playbook from Ansible h-1 where I deployed "msg-service". <br>

So, in this home task I have to create custom image with Packer on GCP and after that create VM instance from image. Link on files: <br>
[packer.json](https://github.com/borovoykirill/Ansible/blob/day-3/roles/nginx-base/tasks/main.yml) <br>
[here you can find my playbook](https://github.com/borovoykirill/Ansible/blob/day-3/roles/web-service/tasks/main.yml) <br>


**Done** <br>
